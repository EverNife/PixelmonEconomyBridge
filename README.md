# PixelmonEconomyBridge

A plugin de that creates a bridge between Pixelmon economy system and Bukkit.

On bukkit there is no 'EconomyUpdatEvent' so you might need a plugin that has it, like FinalEconomy

So. In order to use this plugin you need:

+ [Vault Plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/)
+ [EverNifeCore Plugin](https://github.com/evernife/EverNifeCore)
+ Any other economy manager plugin like Essentials, CMI, or the best option for increased performance, [FinalEconomy](https://github.com/evernife/FinalEconomy
  )
